About 5 years ago I was working as a receptionist at the university I was attending. Around this same time I had also graduated from my Bachelors of Religious studies degree.

It was my weekend to work, 8am-330pm. At noon, I took my lunch break and I decided I was going to take a walk to the ravine nearby. It was a beautiful day; the sun was shining with not a cloud in the sky. I saw a massive rock by the water and decided I would sit there and eat. I sat down and took out my tuna sandwich. Before I could even take one bite, tears started to flow down my face. For the past few months, during this time, I was in a terrible mental state. The grip of anxiety and depression was so heavy I could hardly sleep most nights. The depression felt so unbearable. I remember feeling so worthless and asking myself why do I even exist? What purpose do I serve? I am nothing, worth nothing. I cried out to God and I told him that I wanted to end my life. I specifically prayed “God, if I see a robin land on the rock next to me, I won’t act upon these thoughts right now”. In about 30 secs after I prayed, there it was. A little robin just sitting there on the rock.

I was completely shocked & so overwhelmed. For the first time in months I felt a little bit of hope. That regardless of the pit I was in, He was right there- fighting for me and wanting to rescue me.

Break was obviously about over and I had to get back to the desk. I composed myself, and walked back to the university. When I got back to my desk there was a book laid there with a little sticky note on the cover saying “for the receptionist who sits here”. The book was titled “God’s love Song” by Ginny Allen. AND I KID YOU NOT, the front cover is a robin sitting on a branch (seriously- go google the book)! 

Friends- GOD LOVES YOU, and He longs to rescue you. He love’s us more than we can ever fathom or ever comprehend. I am not sure why I felt to share this story- but my prayer is that someone can be blessed thru it. That you’ll know, regardless of how empty you may feel in this season- Jesus cares, he understands, and He wants you! He wants to rescue you, to bless you, and to set you free. Jesus said, So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows (Matthew 10:31). 

“God wants to use you. But first, He wants to rescue you, if that’s what you need right now. Maybe He’s whispering in your ear, “I have you. I’m holding you. I won’t ever let you go.” – Ginney Allen.
