The Calling of Florence<br>
<br>
I felt a calling from above to care for those in need<br>
His divine voice spoke to me and brought me to my knees.<br>
Four times he called out to me, “Florence, you must go”<br>
It was then I surrendered to his will and my love for nursing began to grow.<br>
<br>
Angel with the lamp they call me, to rid of all the dark<br>
I went to care for soldiers and there my nursing journey did embark.<br>
These soldiers were in dire need, oh, I can still see them now,<br>
Their wounds, the filth, the calamity; something has to change to this I make my vow.<br>
<br>  
I can still remember the horrible smell, it was a very unclean place<br>
I can still see the fear, dismay and the sickness on every soldier’s face.<br>
There were little tiny creatures crawling all around,<br>
How would these soldiers ever heal- where so much uncleanliness was found?<br>
<br>  
These soldiers needed a change, the environment should be clean<br>
I practiced the importance of cleanliness, pure air and hand hygiene.<br>
I dressed their wounds with bandages and treated all their pain<br>
And it was not too long before we started to see soldiers feeling well again.<br>
<br>
I am thankful for my calling and all the work that I have done<br>
But, I know, it has only truly just begun!<br>
There are so many others that need our loving care,<br>
What a privilege to be a nurse- our calling truly is so rare.</p>
