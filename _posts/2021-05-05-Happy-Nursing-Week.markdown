What a crazy time it has been! The world as we know it literally has turned upside down due to COVID-19. 
This pandemic has changed our everyday lives in more ways than I can even express. From not being able to visit our 
families, unable to hug and kiss grandparents living in long term care homes, kids unable to play with their friends,
and the list goes on and on. 

Nurses have been at the frontlines of this exhausting battle fighting this virus every single day. We show up to work, many of
us in fear, praying that we do not bring this virus home to our loved ones. Nurses have worked tirelessly and courageously to provide
patients with the hightest quality of care despite all the struggles that COVID-19 beings. We have held the hands of many sick patients 
who were unable to have physical contact with their loved onces due to this illness. 

As Nursing Week 2021 approaches, I wanted to dedicate this post to ALL my fellow Nurses. I am so honoured to be apart
of this beautiful profession. As draining as it can sometimes be, I am blessed to be able to care for so many individuals
who need our love and light right now. To Nurses everywhere - THANK YOU - for all that you have done and continue to do for your patients and the many
sacrifices that you make for the profession. You are all angels on this earth. 

Below is a poem I wrote about the calling of Florence Nightingale and her journey into Nursing. I wanted to dedicate it to all 
nurses who listened to their calling. May these words bring you joy during this Nurses Week! HAPPY NURSES WEEK!! XO

The Calling of Florence<br>
<br>
I felt a calling from above to care for those in need<br>
His divine voice spoke to me and brought me to my knees.<br>
Four times he called out to me, “Florence, you must go”<br>
It was then I surrendered to his will and my love for nursing began to grow.<br>
<br>
Angel with the lamp they call me, to rid of all the dark<br>
I went to care for soldiers and there my nursing journey did embark.<br>
These soldiers were in dire need, oh, I can still see them now,<br>
Their wounds, the filth, the calamity; something has to change to this I make my vow.<br>
<br>  
I can still remember the horrible smell, it was a very unclean place<br>
I can still see the fear, dismay and the sickness on every soldier’s face.<br>
There were little tiny creatures crawling all around,<br>
How would these soldiers ever heal- where so much uncleanliness was found?<br>
<br>  
These soldiers needed a change, the environment should be clean<br>
I practiced the importance of cleanliness, pure air and hand hygiene.<br>
I dressed their wounds with bandages and treated all their pain<br>
And it was not too long before we started to see soldiers feeling well again.<br>
<br>
I am thankful for my calling and all the work that I have done<br>
But, I know, it has only truly just begun!<br>
There are so many others that need our loving care,<br>
What a privilege to be a nurse- our calling truly is so rare.</p>
