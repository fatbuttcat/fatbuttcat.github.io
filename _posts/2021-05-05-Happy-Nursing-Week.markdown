The Calling of Florence

I felt a calling from above to care for those in need
His divine voice spoke to me and brought me to my knees.
Four times he called out to me, “Florence, you must go”
It was then I surrendered to his will and my love for nursing began to grow.

Angel with the lamp they call me, to rid of all the dark
I went to care for soldiers and there my nursing journey did embark.
These soldiers were in dire need, oh, I can still see them now,

Their wounds, the filth, the calamity; something has to change to this I make my vow.
I can still remember the horrible smell, it was a very unclean place
I can still see the fear, dismay and the sickness on every soldier’s face.
There were little tiny creatures crawling all around,

How would these soldiers ever heal- where so much uncleanliness was found?
These soldiers needed a change, the environment should be clean
I practiced the importance of cleanliness, pure air and hand hygiene.
I dressed their wounds with bandages and treated all their pain
And it was not too long before we started to see soldiers feeling well again.
I am thankful for my calling and all the work that I have done

But, I know, it has only truly just begun!
There are so many others that need our loving care,
What a privilege to be a nurse- our calling truly is so rare.</p>
